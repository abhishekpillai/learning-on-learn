# Learning On Learn

## Outline

Objectives (Students will be able to):

Explain that all the learning content on Learn is stored in Github
Describe Github as a version control repository system that allows people to make revisions and work together on projects.
Identify the different content types on Learn:
Lesson, Lab, Quiz
	You don’t have to use Lesson, but I don’t think a Readme or Reading is a proper word to use because a) labs have readmes b) if you’re adding videos, then they’re not strictly readmes. I think Lesson, Lab, Codealong Lab (which will distinguish it from just a regular spec lab), Codealong Lesson (since iOS doesn’t always have tests and for now, not all of our codealongs are test-driven so this can be a content type that will be phased out but should be used now), and Quiz is fine. If there’s a better word than Lesson (since a lab right now is a lesson), fine to use. Also up to you as to whether Code Challenges should be mentioned too.
if you want to go into more detail on how information repeats in lessons, how certain labs are easy, and others will take a long time to work on, then here would be the time.
Describe a track as a series of topics which are composed of a series of units which in turn are composed of primarily lessons and labs
Use the Ask a Question function


## Overview

As you make your way through content on Learn, you'll come across four types of lessons.

(1) Readings

Simply read the material, or watch the videos in your browser. Use the "I'm done" button to signal that you've read the lesson and unlock the “Next Lesson” button.

(2) Quizzes

Read the material and then test what you’ve learned so far with a quiz. Once you’ve answered every quiz question in the lesson the “Quiz” light will turn green. You can use the “I’m done” button to signal you’ve completed the lesson, and unlock the “Next Lesson” button.

(3) Code Challenges

Read the material and then test your code knowledge with these short coding challenges. Once you’ve finished every challenge for the lesson the Code Challenge light will turn green. You can use the “I’m done” button to signal you’ve completed the lesson, and unlock the “Next Lesson” button.

(4) Code Labs

This is the most interactive lesson type on Learn, and will test your skills while using a real developer workflow. You will need to do some work on your computer in order to solve the lesson and proceed. Below is some detailed information about how to complete a lab.
