# Learning On Learn

Whew. You made it. Welcome to Learn! We're so thrilled to have you join our community of hungry developers, looking to learn to code in a way that actually prepares you to be a professional developer. Expect it to be a little bit more difficult than other online learning platform, but we know you're up for the challenge. And don't forget, we don't believe in Learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into other Learners just like you, and help each other succeed. 

To recap: at this point, you've already created a Learn account, got a local development environment set up, and you've confirmed that that dev environment can talk to Learn.

Before you start learning to code, it's worth spending a few minutes getting oriented. In the handful of lessons that follow, we'll walk you through a few things: 

1. How content is organized on Learn
2. How to use your Terminal
3. How Learn uses Git & Github
4. The workflow you'll use to learn to code on Learn

Let's start by talking about different types of curriculum on Learn.

## All about lessons

We call the individual pieces of curriculum on Learn lessons. A track is composed of many lessons, often organized into units and topics. On the left side, you'll see and be able to navigate this track. You can only view lessons that you've completed and your current lesson. You must complete a lesson before you're able to advance to the next one. 

Broadly, there are two different types of lessons on Learn: labs and readings.

1. **Labs** are lessons that have a lesson description and instructions that you'll read here on Learn, but also—and importantly—they have a coding exercise associated with them that you'll copy down to your computer to solve. We've designed the labs in a track so that some will be fairly easy to solve while others will require time. In other words, in order to complete a lab, you need to write code. Once you've successfully solved and submitted a lab, the idea you'll see the Next Lesson button light up on the right side of your screen on Learn. We'll tell you all about how to do this very soon.

2. **Readings** are lessons that only have instructional content— that is to say, no coding exercise that you need to solve on your computer. They may sometimes involve videos to watch or even interactive quizzes to solve, but they don't involve writing code locally on your computer. Once you've completed a reading, you need to manually click the "I'm done" button on the right side of your screen. You should see the Next Lesson button light up, allowing you to proceed. 

Seeing as this lesson is a reading (that is, there is no code to write) you're now done and ready to go to the next lesson. Go ahead and click the "I'm Done" button now. 

Happy Learning!
